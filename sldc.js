    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." ;

const design = "In this stage, we will create a blue print for the product. This will include how we will accomplish our expectations. It will also help all parts of a team have a structure to see where they are in the project as a whole."; 

const implementation = "This is the stage we will start coding. We will take our blueprint and begin to implement the ideas into code. It's also important to set due dates and deadlines to ensure we will finish on time.";

const maintain = "At this point in the SDL we have our first version out and being used. Now our job is to maintain and fix bugs that arise.";
